# AGENTS

## Mission

Build the MVP: scan -> list -> tap -> history.

## Hard constraints

- No Android Studio usage (everything must work via CLI + VS Code)
- Reproducible environment setup (script + docs)
- No cloud; no remote logging by default

## Toolchain rules

- Use Android SDK Command-line Tools (sdkmanager, platform-tools, etc.)
- Require JDK 17
- Pin AGP/Gradle versions using the official matrix; avoid dynamic versions

## Definition of Done (MVP)

- On a physical Android device: can scan, see list, tap a device, see a persisted history after relaunch
- Permission handling is robust (clear messaging, recoverable states)
- No crashes when Bluetooth is off or permissions denied

## Implementation guidance

- Treat observed device identifiers as observations, not ground truth identity
- Assume devices may rotate addresses and change names; design for partial stability
- Optimize for battery by time-limiting scans and avoiding constant background behavior (MVP stays foreground)
- Keep passive identity/grouping separate from classification; soft fingerprints can inform category/confidence but should not silently become stable physical identity
- Do not trust OUI/vendor-prefix resolution on randomized/local BLE addresses; prefer manufacturer company ID, advertised services, and other passive fields with explicit confidence levels
- Active BLE enrichment must stay opt-in from the detail page, never happen during scans automatically, and remain local-only

## PR discipline

- Small PRs, each linked to TODO item
- Add or update docs with every new requirement
- Commit and push after every task; if a push is blocked, surface the blocker immediately
- Track active multi-step work in `TODO.md` and update the checklist before or during implementation as scope changes
- Keep `TODO.md` lean: it is an active backlog, not a completion log
- Remove completed items from `TODO.md` instead of leaving checked-off history behind
- For long-running work, commit and push each completed sub-task even when the larger feature is still in progress

## Recursive learning

- Update `AGENTS.md` whenever you learn anything important about the project, workflow, or collaborator preferences
- Capture both wins and misses: what to repeat, what to avoid, and any blocker that slowed delivery
- Keep notes concrete and reusable: build/test commands, deployment steps, project structure, coding conventions, pitfalls, and formatting preferences
- Prefer small, timely updates in the same task that revealed the learning, and replace stale guidance when it is superseded

## Agent memory checklist

- Build/test: `./gradlew assembleDebug`, `./gradlew installDebug`, and `scripts/stage-apk`
- Local validation needs `ANDROID_HOME` / `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`; on this workstation the SDK is at `~/Android/Sdk`
- Headless AVD boot can be flaky on this workstation; if the emulator exits immediately, fall back to `assembleDebug` + unit tests and verify on-device
- Compatibility mode is toggled from Diagnostics and uses BLE-only `SCAN_MODE_BALANCED` while keeping the scan session continuous
- Diagnostics now has a `Copy scan debug report` action with platform/build info, persisted device inventory, and recent scan events
- `unagi` now matches WiGLE's scan-relevant permission posture by requesting `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` and `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` alongside modern Bluetooth scan/connect permissions
- When shipping a user-visible APK change, bump `versionCode` and `versionName` in `app/build.gradle.kts` and keep the installed version obvious in the main UI
- Since `targetSdk` is 35, new top-level screens need explicit system-bar inset handling or the toolbar can overlap the Android 15 status bar
- Device identity is now richer: prefer BLE advertised local names over generic Bluetooth names, and resolve vendor prefixes locally from the bundled IEEE MA-L / MA-M / MA-S registries
- Android package identity is now `guru.urchin`; changing `applicationId` means old `ninja.spider` installs do not upgrade in place
- MainActivity display prefs now persist in `MainDisplayPreferences`; compact device-card density stays in the overflow menu, and filter/recovery controls now live in a left-edge drawer opened from the toolbar filter icon instead of a top banner
- Alert rules now live in the dedicated Alerts screen and can match OUI, full MAC, or Bluetooth name with a chosen emoji and sound preset
- Alert notifications are posted on a silent channel and the audible alert is played manually, so different presets stay distinct without depending on per-channel OS sounds
- The vendor-prefix asset may be packaged in the APK as `vendor_prefixes.txt` even when the source file is `vendor_prefixes.txt.gz`, so the loader must handle both names and both plain/gzip content
- Deployment: GitHub Pages publishes from `main` at repo root to `https://urchin.guru`
- Site artifacts: keep `index.html`, the current versioned APK in `downloads/`, and `CNAME` aligned when shipping landing-page changes
- On every release, run `scripts/stage-apk` so the staged APK filename includes the current version and the website download links are updated before commit/push
- Collaborator preference: any app change that adds user-visible behavior should be treated as a release trigger; bump `versionCode`/`versionName`, publish the staged APK/site updates, and do not defer release chores to a later cleanup pass
- Vendor-prefix data is refreshed with `scripts/update-vendor-prefixes`, which writes `app/src/main/assets/vendor_prefixes.txt.gz`
- Bluetooth SIG assigned-number data is refreshed with `scripts/update-bluetooth-assigned-numbers`, which writes `app/src/main/assets/bluetooth_company_identifiers.txt.gz` and `app/src/main/assets/bluetooth_service_uuids.txt.gz`
- When unnamed BLE devices still lack a human name, prefer surfacing manufacturer-company IDs and advertised service UUID labels rather than leaving the UI at a bare “Unknown device”
- The current `DeviceKey` fallback order is collision-prone for common manufacturer/service payloads; future work should separate identity keys from classification fingerprints before deepening device intelligence
- If active BLE querying is added, stop scanning first, keep it opt-in from `DeviceDetailActivity`, store enrichment separately from passive metadata, and treat DIS/GATT reads as hints rather than truth
- Passive scan metadata now stores address type, vendor confidence/source, classification category/confidence/evidence, and a separate classification fingerprint; keep those fields in `lastMetadataJson` rather than overloading `deviceKey`
- Treat classic Bluetooth discovery addresses as public for vendor-confidence purposes, but keep BLE OUI confidence downgraded unless the address type is explicitly public
- Active BLE enrichment now persists in the `device_enrichments` Room table; keep it separate from passive observation JSON and include it in Diagnostics/export paths
- Device Details now has top-right copy/save/share export actions; the export payload includes the device row, parsed passive metadata, and active BLE enrichment, but intentionally excludes the sightings list
- `UrchinApp` now owns the shared `ScanController`, so detail-page BLE queries can explicitly stop scans before opening a GATT connection
- `Continuous scanning` is the persisted background-capable passive mode in `ContinuousScanPreferences`; when it is enabled, scanning should run via `ContinuousScanService` instead of being tied to `MainActivity`
- Background-capable continuous scanning needs `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` on Android 10/11 plus a `connectedDevice` foreground service notification; keep the permission flow and manifest declarations aligned
- Continuous scanning now prompts for a battery-optimization exemption from `MainActivity`; keep that prompt tied to the mode enable/start path so users understand why the app may be killed otherwise
- Foreground-service and alert notifications should both use `ic_unagi_status`, not the launcher asset, so the status-bar icon stays recognizable and monochrome
- On Android 13+, continuous scanning should request `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` from the scan-start flow too; otherwise the foreground-service notice can fall out of the notification drawer even though scanning is still running
- If the active-scan notification is expected to show a status-bar icon, do not use a low-importance channel; low importance suppresses that icon on modern Android
- Boot autostart is now controlled by `StartOnBootPreferences` and `ContinuousScanBootReceiver`; only restart the service on `BOOT_COMPLETED` when both continuous scanning and start-on-boot are enabled
- Device history now treats `sightingsCount` as deduped presence sessions, not raw callback volume; use `observationCount` for signal-stat sampling math and diagnostics
- Star state now lives on `DeviceEntity`; keep starred filters wired off persisted state instead of transient UI-only flags
- The main toolbar now owns the scan start/stop action and live-device count; keep filter/recovery UI in the left-edge drawer instead of spending vertical space on a top banner again
- Installed version info no longer lives in the main banner; keep it in the overflow menu and Diagnostics so the header stays compact
- User-facing brand text in the Android app should use `Urchin`, matching the package/domain rename to `guru.urchin` and `urchin.guru`
- The Spider -> Urchin rename now covers the Android namespace/application ID (`guru.urchin`), GitHub Pages domain (`urchin.guru`), and staged APK basename (`urchin-v...-debug.apk`)
- `Formatters.formatTimestamp` is used from live scan/UI paths across threads; keep it on immutable `java.time` formatters and avoid shared mutable `DateFormat`
- The filter drawer now includes `Live only`; keep it aligned with the header count by reusing the same live-device window logic
- The Alerts screen now uses a FAB + modal editor flow; keep add and edit behavior on the same validated dialog instead of growing a permanent inline form again
- Passive vendor decoders now live in `PassiveVendorDecoderRegistry`; they should add soft hints (ecosystem, beacon/tracker/dev-board style) without claiming stable product identity
- Default alert rules are seeded once from `DefaultAlertSeeder`; use versioned seed keys so new defaults can ship without duplicating or constantly re-adding deleted user rules
- Continuous scanning can flood Room with callbacks if maintenance work runs on every observation; keep pruning throttled and heavy list-presentation work off the main thread
- Keep the term `active` reserved for explicit per-device BLE enrichment/query actions; the passive background-capable mode is `continuous scanning`
- The overflow menu now has a separate `Active BLE queries` toggle; keep it distinct from `Continuous scanning`, default it off, and use it only to gate manual detail-page GATT reads
- To keep the device list readable during scans, prefer session-level recency (`lastSightingAt`) over packet-level `lastSeen` for list ordering, suppress tiny RSSI-only row diffs, and avoid RecyclerView change animations
- SDR/TPMS integration lives in `guru.urchin.sdr/`; `SdrController` orchestrates USB (`Rtl433Process`) and network (`Rtl433NetworkBridge`) paths, feeding observations through the shared `ObservationRecorder`
- TPMS sensors have no MAC address; `DeviceKey` uses name-based keying (`"n:TPMS Toyota 0x00ABCDEF"` → SHA-256), stable per sensor since 32-bit sensor IDs don't rotate
- SDR transport → TPMS_SENSOR classification with score 100 (HIGH confidence); rtl_433 already decoded the protocol, so classification is definitive
- For development testing without SDR hardware, use network bridge mode: run `rtl_433 -f 433.92M -F json:tcp:0.0.0.0:1234` on desktop, or use `scripts/tpms-simulator.py` for fully simulated data; configure `SdrPreferences` with source=NETWORK, host=desktop-IP, port=1234
- SDR Diagnostics now includes live USB inventory with VID/PID/permission status plus packaged native-tool paths for `rtl_433`, `dump1090`, and `p25_scanner`; unsupported USB attach/detach events are logged too, so hot-plug failures are easier to trace from the app
- `bash scripts/setup-third-party.sh` now needs to run before `./gradlew assembleDebug`; it clones or reuses the SDR deps, reapplies tracked Android patches (currently `rtl-sdr-android-usb-fd.patch`), and the tracked `third_party/CMakeLists.txt` bridges them into a buildable native tree
- Android blocks executing SDR binaries from app-writable directories; keep `rtl_433`, `dump1090`, and `p25_scanner` packaged as native executables under extracted `lib/<abi>/...` paths instead of extracting them into `files/` or `no_backup/`
- `packaging.jniLibs.useLegacyPackaging = true` is currently required so the merged manifest sets `android:extractNativeLibs="true"` and those staged `lib*.so` executables actually land in `nativeLibraryDir` on-device
- The Android wrapper still disables upstream rtl_433 tests, shims `pthread_cancel()`, and now stages the built SDR executables into generated `jniLibs` so `nativeLibraryDir` contains runnable tool paths on-device
- For bundled USB RTL-SDR capture, use a plain numeric/default device selector (`-d 0` or omit `-d`) with the wrapped Android USB fd; `driver=rtlsdr` is a SoapySDR selector and will fail in the current non-Soapy build
- `scripts/setup-third-party.sh` currently reapplies tracked patches to both `rtl-sdr` and `rtl_433`; if a bundled native-tool behavior change lives under `third_party/`, record it as a patch file instead of relying on a dirty vendored checkout
- Unrooted Android USB capture needed an explicit UsbManager fd relay into `librtlsdr`; `RtlSdrUsbRelay` now duplicates the granted fd into `rtl_433`/`p25_scanner`, and HackRF remains network-bridge-only until a Soapy/USB path is actually bundled
- Branding assets now live in multiple places: keep `favicon.svg`, `og_image.png`, `index.html`'s header mark, `ic_launcher_foreground.xml`, the legacy launcher vector, and `ic_unagi_status.xml` visually aligned whenever the logo changes
- The emulator AVD is `unagi_test`; source `scripts/dev-env.sh` to set up PATH and the `start-emulator` helper function
- `ObservationRecorder` is the shared pipeline for both BLE/Classic (`ScanController`) and SDR (`SdrController`) observations — handles metadata JSON, DB writes, and alert matching in one place
- Reflection: before handoff, record any new command, pitfall, deploy detail, or collaborator preference discovered during the task
